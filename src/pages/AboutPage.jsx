            Imaginarium is not a game in the conventional sense; 
            you can't win and you don't get a score!

            The satisfaction of the game come from the esthetically pleasing buildings you create by
            dragging the different elements together on a canvas.
            Imaginarium is a meditative, calming and satisfying escape into a dream world!
